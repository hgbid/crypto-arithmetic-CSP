# crypto-arithmetic-CSP
Crypto-arithmetic is a type of mathematical puzzle that involves solving equations involving numbers and letters.
A Crypto-arithmetic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a variation of this puzzle in which the goal is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. These constraints may include rules such as "the letter 'S' must be equal to a certain number," or "the sum of two numbers represented by letters must be equal to a third number represented by a letter." The goal is to find a solution that satisfies all of the constraints, which is typically done using techniques from artificial intelligence and constraint satisfaction, such as search and backtracking.
